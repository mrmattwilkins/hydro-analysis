# Hydro Analysis

`hydro-analysis` provides functions for Hydrology DEM manipulation.  There are
a couple generic functions for reading/writing raster files of any common
primative type (which surprizingly I couldn't find anywhere else, unless you
use GDAL which I am trying to avoid).  Also there are a couple functions based
on [whitebox](https://github.com/jblindsay/whitebox-tools).  Whitebox is a
command line tool, this provides functionality via functions so can be called
from your code.
