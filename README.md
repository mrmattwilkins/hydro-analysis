# Hydro Analysis

`hydro-analysis` provides functions for Hydrology DEM manipulation that are based on
[whitebox](https://github.com/jblindsay/whitebox-tools).  Whitebox is a command line tool, this
crate provides some (only a couple functions at present) of that functionality via functions so
can be called from your code.
